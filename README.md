A smart house features a set of sensors that may be used to record the behavior of a person living in the
house. The historical log of the personâ€™s activity is stored as tuples (startTime, endTime, activityLabel),
where startTime and endTime represent the date and time when each activity has started and ended while
the activity label represents the type of activity performed by the person: Leaving, Toileting, Showering,
Sleeping, Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snack, Spare_Time/TV, Grooming.
The attached log file Activities.txt contains a set of activity records over a certain period of time.
